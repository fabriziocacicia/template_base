# Base Template 
The base template that all the repositories should create from.

## Features
- PR Auto Labeler: automatically labels all PRs based on their type specified in the title (chore:, docs:, feat:, etc...)
- `.gitignore`: exclude all the most common file generated by the JetBrains IDEs and macOS specific files
- Keep History Conventional: keeps in the commits history of the `main` branch only the commits that follows the [Conventional Commits][1] convention
- Conventional PR Titles: checks that the title of PRs follows the [Conventional Commits][1] convention
- Template Sync: automatically keeps the repository in sync with its template

## Usage
1) Fork this repo or use it as template to create a new repo
2) Add some secrets to the repo before usage:
    - Add a secret called `PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` where the value is a personal access token which has `repo` and `workflow` permissions
    - Add the repository name of the template in a secret called `TEMPLATE_REPO_NAME` 
    - Add the username of the owner of the repository of the template in a secret called `REPO_OWNER_USERNAME`
